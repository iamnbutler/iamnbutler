### Hi friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nate, a designer & developer. I like building tools, automating things, and contributing to design education.

- ðŸ›‘ I'm not currently looking for any roles or projects, full-time or freelance.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm building [Zed](https://www.zed.dev), a fast, collaborative code editor written in Rust, at [@zed-industries](https://github.com/zed-industries)
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Vue & Nuxt, building a portfolio site [in the open](https://twitter.com/iamnbutler/status/1458137891964661765), and prototyping a [personal data repository](https://github.com/iamnbutler/data).
- ðŸ“£ I'm looking for people to help contribute to [early career design education & career readiness](https://github.com/iamnbutler/design-industry-intro).
