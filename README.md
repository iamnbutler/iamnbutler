### Hi friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software designer & maker enabling people's creativity and ability share knowledge. Chances are you have probably used something I've built.

I want to help people create the things important to themâ€”To empower them to create something themselves and feel the euphoria it brings.

Day to day I work primarily in design in Figma and build software in Rust, with some TypeScript on the side for prototyping.

I'm interested in local & open source software, and finding ways to reclaim our applications from the web and our daily lives from large corporations.
